# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 02

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed for Task 02 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science internship. The objective of this task was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset, exploring relationships between variables and identifying patterns and trends.

## Task Description
### Task 02: Data Cleaning and EDA
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Ensured the dataset was prepared for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Created various visualizations such as bar charts and histograms.
   - Analyzed relationships between variables.
   - Identified patterns and trends in the data.

## Visualizations
- **Bar Charts**: Used to show the survival rate by gender and passenger class.
- **Histograms**: Used to display the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Titanic dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Repository Structure

- titanic: Contains the dataset used for the visualizations.
- PRODIGY_DS_02: Contains ipynb file with the created visualizations.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the task and how to use the repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the Titanic dataset from the link above and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to see the data cleaning and EDA process.

## Getting Started

To get started with viewing the visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Tableau installed on your machine.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
3. Open the PRODIGY_DS_02.ipynb file for the visualizations and Data cleaning.
4. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding the importance of data cleaning and the use of EDA to uncover insights from data. Through visualizations, we could identify key patterns and relationships within the dataset.
